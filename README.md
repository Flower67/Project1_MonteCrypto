## Project Description: 
Our group looked at the performance of different investment instruments over time to see which types of investments gave the greatest return over a 5 year horizon, and which instruments were projected to give the greatest return in the future.  We compared a small portfolio of stocks, a portfolio of crypto currency, a portfolio comprised of investments in metals, one invested in agricultural commodities, and also an investment in a index fund tied to the S&P500.  In addition to looking at returns of the individual investments, we also wanted to determine what would be the 'optimal' portfolio mix of all the investments together, using the sharpe ratio to optimize risk and return.  We also wanted to test if this 'optimal' mix would change when looking at investment performance pre-COVID vs. post-COVID.  


## Questions 

**Question 1:Assuming investments in the S&P 500, a portfolio of stocks, commodities, metals, and cryptocurrency, from January 1, 2015 through October 31, 2020, which investment type has yielded the highest return??**
*Answer: The Cryptocurrency portfolio (a mix of BTC, ETH, and LTC) had the best historical returns over a five year period.*

**Question 2: Which type of investment is projected to have the greatest return over the next five years?**
*Answer: Investing in a stock portfolio - either a mix of individual stocks or the S&P 500 - projected the greatest return over 5 years.  

There is a 95% chance that an pre-COVID initial investment of $100,000 in commodities over the next 5 years will end within in the range of $36478.49 and $93963.88.  This amount increases to a range of $65072.74 and $169948.66 using Post-COVID data.  
There is a 95% chance that an pre-COVID initial investment of $100,000 in metals over the next 5 years will end within in the range of $0.0 and $2452.1.  This amount increases to a range of $89692.53 and $658276.44 using Post-COVID data. 
There is a 95% chance that an pre-COVID initial investment of $100,000 in stocks over the next 5 years will end within in the range of $140212.92 and $437573.29.  This amount changed to a range of $13778.17 and $250966.36 using Post-COVID data.
There is a 95% chance that an pre-COVID initial investment of $100,000 in S&P 500 over the next 5 years will end within in the range of $90638.08 and $299660.57.  This amount changed to a range of $15151.74 and $416304.94 using Post-COVID data.

**Question 3: What's the ideal portfolio mix of all investments?**
**Question 4: Did COVID impact the ideal optimal portfolio?**
The ideal portfolio is a mix of all investments, and changed significantly pre- and post-COVID.  For example the largest 3 investments in the pre-COVID optimal portfolio are: Gold, AAPL, and AMZN.  The 3 largest investments in the post-COVID portfolio are: ETH, Soybeans, and AMZN.

We were surprised to see that while Crypto currency had the best historical returns, it didn't compose a large portion of the ideal portfolio.  We attributed this to the fact that crypto was high return, but it was also high risk and showed significant volatility.
